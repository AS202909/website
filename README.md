# AS202909 KUEBLER Research Lab – Sovereign European Networking

Welcome to the official repository of the **AS202909 KUEBLER Research Lab**. This project is an independent, non-commercial initiative dedicated to exploring the frontiers of BGP routing, Anycast architectures, and network resilience within the European jurisdiction.

## 🌐 Mission & Vision

AS202909 serves as a technical sandbox to investigate decentralized infrastructure models. Our research focuses on:

- **Data Sovereignty:** Strategies to keep European traffic flows within regional legal boundaries.
- **Anycast Optimization:** Latency-based steering using advanced BGP community frameworks.
- **Network Resilience:** Protocol-level security research, including XDP/eBPF-based traffic analysis.

## 🏗 Project Status: Bootstrapping Phase

We are currently in the initial phase (2025-2026), focusing on:

- Establishing a distributed Anycast footprint across Western, Southern, and Eastern Europe.
- Partnering with strategic infrastructure providers for IP transit and colocation.
- Building an open-source toolchain for network observability.

## 🤝 Collaborative Research

One of our core pillars is **Collaborative Research**. We offer our infrastructure as a neutral testing ground for partners. Strategic sponsors can submit *Research Requests* to analyze specific networking edge cases or protocol behaviors.

### Current Partners

- **Inter.link (AS5405):** Connectivity & IP-Transit Sponsor.

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Open Source only)

To maintain transparency and independence, we rely exclusively on open-source software:

- **Routing:** Bird Internet Routing Daemon (BIRD) / GoBGP
- **OS:** Debian / Alpine Linux
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, and custom eBPF probes.
- **Website:** Hosted on Cloudflare Pages (via this repository).
